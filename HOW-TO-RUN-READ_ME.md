# AStar-Algorithm

- This A Star algorithm that I built  makes a random grid that is 100x100 large, it picks a random start and end spot and then finds the shortest path between those 2 points using the A Star Algorithm.
- To run the code, run the "AStarTest.java". This will make a random grid everytime you run it. The grid making algorithm that I designed always makes a grid such if you pick a 2 random open points in the grid, there will always be a path between them.
